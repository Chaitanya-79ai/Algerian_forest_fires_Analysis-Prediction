# Algerian_forest_fires_Analysis-Prediction

Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of Algerian_forest_fires
The aim of this project is to perform Data Analysis on Algerian_forest_fires dataset and  train a regression model to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) 
The Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a numeric rating that estimates the danger of forest fires

NOTE : While running the project file in jupyter notebook restart the kernel and run each cell one by one to avoid errors
